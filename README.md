## code for this paper  
`test2.m` is for fig. 2, an illustration of the shortwave and longwave radiation, the equilibrium states, and the potential;  
`dTdt3.m` is a function to calculate the temperature change at each time step;  
`calculateTseries2000.m` is to generate simulated temperature time series, using the function in `dTdt3m`;  
`figures2000.m` is for plotting, with the data from `calculateTseries2000.m` loaded.
